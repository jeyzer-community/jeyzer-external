This directory is a place holder for the declaration of the repositories of shared profiles.
The referenced repositories must be compatible with the Jeyzer project version.

Shared profile repositories are used as part of the static and dynamic shared profile path resolution.
Create your own shared profile to reflect a particular storage location or company department.

By default, the "demo" and "company" (template) repository definitions are provided.
The "base" repository is the Jeyzer standard one, declared within the Jeyzer installation.
Current directory is declared in the setup file of your master profile.
